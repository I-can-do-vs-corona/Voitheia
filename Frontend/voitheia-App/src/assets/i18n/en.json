In the following, the functions of the Weibseite are described first from the inquirer's point of view, and then from the helper's point of view. Requesters can choose one or more of a selection of different support offers. Offers can be, for example, shopping, accompaniment to the doctor or picking up prescriptions from pharmacies, childcare or pet care. Together with this request, the requestor provides personal data such as address and telephone number. If the enquirer already has a user profile, these fields are filled in automatically. If the request is not accepted within five days, it is considered to be no longer relevant and is automatically deleted. Helpers must register in the first step. As soon as a user profile has been created, the helper will receive an overview of the request offers from his environment, sorted by distance. The helper can only see the first name of the requester, type of request and distance in km. He can accept one or more requests from this list. Only after accepting a request the helper can see the phone number of the requester. Other data, such as last name or address, are not accessible via the platform. The helper can now contact the requester using the telephone number to clarify details of the request. The helper can view and manage his accepted requests in Voitheia at any time.

The user is not obliged to provide all possible data; however, it must be ensured that the contact is provided in a form sufficient for Voitheia to function properly. In particular, this includes the disclosure of certain contact information for the purpose of establishing contact between inquirer and helper. If such data is not provided, this can result in Voitheia not functioning or only being able to be used to a limited extent. The following data is collected and processed to provide the service:",

In order to determine the distance between the requester and the helper, a service of the Bing-Maps of Microsoft Inc. (for more information: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/create-a-bing-maps-key/) via a Bing API is used. The location data is sent to the API without any personal reference, i.e. anonymized. The calculated difference between the two locations is displayed in Voitheia. Voitheia's data is processed in a so-called "Key Vault" (database for secure data storage), in which the user configurations, security keys and access data to the database ("Connection strings") are stored in a securely encrypted form to prevent possible misuse. The web application is hosted on a Microsoft Azure environment. The resources used for this are located in Frankfurt, Germany.
